# Elmer_IM2D_cases
Example cases for 2D IM modelling in Elmer.

The model consists of 90-degrees sector of IM cross-section representing one 
magnetic pole. 

Example 2D cases demonstrate typical workflow from very simple static model, through time-harmonic and time-transient simulations with kinematics and electrical circuit couplings and iron losses calculation. Addtionally, a 2.5D multi-slice model is given to account for the axial skew. 

The models are prepared within the SEMTEC project during years 2015--2017.
